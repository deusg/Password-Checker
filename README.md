# Password Checker

## Description
The Password Checker is a simple Python program that prompts users to enter a password and checks if it matches a predefined password. 
If the user enters the correct password, the program displays a success message; 
otherwise, it prompts the user to try again until they enter the correct password.

## Usage
1. Run the program by executing the following command: python password_checker.py
2. Enter your password when prompted.
3. If the password is correct, the program will display "Success: You are correct". 
If not, it will prompt you to enter the password again until you get it right.

## Example
Enter your password: ********
Sorry, that is incorrect
Enter your password: ********
Success: You are correct
